          What is the difference between delivery and Pick-Up?
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-500 mt-3">
          If you choose delivery, a foodpanda rider will collect your order from
          the restaurant and take it to your chosen delivery address. If you
          choose Pick-Up, you can self-collect your food directly from the
          restaurant for extra savings – and to jump to the front of the queue.
          Pick-Up orders are available for restaurants only.
        </p>
        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-4">
          Is there a minimum amount I need to spend to order foodpanda?
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-500 mt-3">
          Yes. If you want to order less than the minimum order value, you can
          pay the difference.
